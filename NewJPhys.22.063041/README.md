## About the Work

### Objectives
* Entangling a massive mechanical oscillator to a macroscopic low-frequency LC circuit.

### Novelty
* LC resonator frequency in the radio-frequency domain close to the mechanical frequency.
* Membrane-LC interaction is quadratic in LC charge and linear in mechanical position.
* DC drive to enhance the electromechanical coupling rate.
* Red-detuned laser to cool the mechanical mode.

### Assumptions
* Nearly resonant mechanical and LC oscillators.
* Linearized description of the modes.

### Results
* Strong optomechanical and electromechanical rates are required.
* Entanglement is robust against temperature.
