## About the Work

### Objectives
* Modulated entanglement dynamics between optics and mechanics.

### Novelty
* Driving with mildly amplitude-modulated light.
* No classical feedback or squeezed-light driving.

### Assumptions
* Linearized description of the modes.

### Results
* High degrees of squeezing below the vacuum noise level.
