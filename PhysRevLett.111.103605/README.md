## About the Work

### Objectives
* Introduce quantum synchronization measures for coupled continuous variable systems.
* Study of dynamics of coupled optomechanical systems.

### Novelty
* Extrapolation of notions of complete and phase synchronization in classical models.
* Bounds of quantum mechanics on the achievable level of synchronization.

### Assumptions
* Equal driving and coupling strengths.
* Variable mechanical frequencies.
* Linearized description.

### Results
* Values of complete and phase synchronization are consistent with the fundamental limit.
* No functional relationship between discord and synchronization observed.
